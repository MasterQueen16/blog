# What is our project ? 
EvoBorne, a versatile robot being developed by SRA, designed to conquer diverse landscapes both in the air and on the ground. This morphable marvel transitions effortlessly between drone mode, where it soars through airspace, and a quadrupedal form for terrestrial traversal.
Equipped with a clever configuration of two wheels and two thrusters, the project aims to imbue EvoBorne with autonomous self-balancing capabilities. This will enable the robot to navigate even the steepest terrains in a semi-drone mode, combining the best of aerial and ground mobility.

The ultimate goal? EvoBorne will have a semi-drone mode, allowing it to navigate any environment with ease. This semi-drone capability represents a significant step forward in the evolution of robotics, promising seamless and agile movement across all types of challenging terrain. By use of cutting-edge technologies like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and advanced trajectory planning EvoBorne bot will achieve full autonomy to traverse through its environment. This is the exciting vision driving the development of EvoBorne

# What have we done so far?
### Courses we completed
Over the past two weeks, we delved into various resources. Starting with Linear Algebra, crucial for understanding the geometric implications in our project, we laid a solid foundation. We then studied and implemented the Dshot protocol to interface with the ESC and work with BLDC motors. We also explored Fusion 360 for mechanical design and Ansys to test the strength and durability of our components.

### Practical Implementaion
After completing these courses, we moved on to practical implementation. To ensure safety, we first created a test model—a T-shaped clamp—mounting two BLDC motors on its ends. Using the Dshot protocol, we developed code to run the BLDC(RS2210 980kv) motors. However, during testing, one of the motors burned out, and both motors did not operate at the same speed. We then switched to different BLDC motors and worked on finding the right balance.

We have successfully completed the running of motors using ESC and now trying to find the balance

# What are we dealing with now
To Find the mathematical equation for adjusting the angle of inclination when we mount the propellers

# Difficulties we faced 
We encountered several challenges while building the code and flashing it onto the hardware. Despite these setbacks, our team is dedicated to overcoming these hurdles and advancing the project.
